- Levels are shuffled (and flipped horizontally) around each iteration
- Each level should introduce some kind of new idea or "challenge" (except level 0)
- Fuck games with stories and shit
    - Think of this game as a collection of ideas, in the form of levels
    - The user gets to "explore" all these ideas

- Singletons in game application... problematic?
- CirclePathHelper

- All public/private static final variables should be all-uppercase
- Make level 2 longer
- Color scheme?
- Get custom entity texture working
- Iteration-Complete dialog
- Back button goes to Main Menu (with dialog making sure)
- Fix input handling during tutorial (on desktop, at least)
- Make sure everything (that needs it) is disposed of
