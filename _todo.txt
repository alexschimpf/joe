- Level 0 needs timer countdown label
    - The first level should make a little more sense to the user
    - i.e. The objective should be a little more obvious
- Iteration-Complete dialog
- Back button goes to Main Menu (with dialog making sure)
- Add function: Level.getSafeRandomId()
    - Just to make sure collisions NEVER happen
- Fix input handling during tutorial (on desktop, at least)
