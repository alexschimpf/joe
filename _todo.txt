- Start using Github issues?
    - Remove this file and use _scratch.txt

- Create tweeners to be used on IRender objects
    - Basically mimicking Actor-Action functionality to work with current implementation

1. Revert icon
2. Changing background - MULTIPLE LAYERS NOT WORKING??? WTFFF?? SHOULD THE EDGES BE MORE ROUNDED???

Maybe only shuffles the levels within a "world"
- So world 0 will have levels 0-9, world 1 will have 10-19, etc.
- World 0 will have a different set of textures than the others
- That way you don't have to draw a new version of the entity for each world!
- In other words, an entity must only exist in one world

- Use stateTime instead of lastTime, to keep consistency among all processors

- Before production, all levels should be shuffled (except maybe first 1 or 2)
- When will the background change?
- What to do about textures in Tiled?
    - What if a particular entity's texture is not the same size as the other tiles?
        - Create a new tileset with just that image?
        - Or allow for 'texture' property for entities?
- Are textures being cached properly?
- Should I be using singletons?
- Is it possible now to pack textures inside DesktopLauncher?
- REFACTOR HUD!
    - Separate out tutorial stuff
    - Separate out level complete stuff
- Need to make RunOnceScripts more flexible
    - For example, SetTimer can't extend from it (but should be able to)


- CirclePathHelper
- All public/private static final variables should be all-uppercase
- Make level 2 longer
- Color scheme?
- Get custom entity texture working
- Iteration-Complete dialog
- Back button goes to Main Menu (with dialog making sure)
- Fix input handling during tutorial (on desktop, at least)
- Make sure everything (that needs it) is disposed of
