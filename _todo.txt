ColorScheme
    - Singleton
    - getPrimaryColor
    - getSecondaryColor
    - isShadeOf(Color color)
        - Returns ColorSchemeColorType.PRIMARY or ColorSchemeColorType.SECONDARY
    - These are reset on ILevelLoadBeginEvent
    - Entities can decide which they want to be colored (via entity.json)
        - Default is "primary"
    - Player is always white
        - This should be overridden when Entity gets color from EntityDefinition
TiledMapObjectDetector
    - This will be used in MapLayerWrapper.correctCells
    - Detects the objects and then colors them via ColorScheme (which
        will have reset color beforehand in ILevelLoadBegin)
