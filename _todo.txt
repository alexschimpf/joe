- Singletons in game application... problematic?
- Might need to mute events registered in Driver.show.
- Rename NextLevelToken (LevelEnd?)
- Make everything else fit color scheme:
    - What color should background be?
    - Main Menu
    - Tutorial
    - LevelEnd
    - Text color
    - Level complete
    - Particles

Levels get shuffled around each iteration.
First level has no entities.
    - Just a "Tutorial" level
    - You climb up really high.
        - At one point, you have to cross some bridge to the bottom of another "tower"
        - Tests both lateral and vertical movement

IMPORTANT:
Level design needs to be approached in the following way:
1. What entity/entities will be used?
    - Not all entities have to be created strictly for puzzles (e.g. moving platforms)
2. What puzzles can be created from it/them?
3. Each level consists of sections
    - Each section presents one puzzle
    - OR: Each level is allowed one "tutorial-section"
        - This simply introduces the player to the showcased entity/entities
        - This should help ease them into the puzzles involving them
4. Sections are connected via pathways that aren't TOO cumbersome
    - Focus should be more on solving the puzzles, not just simply being good at the mechanics
    - When is it a "puzzle" and when is it just simply "timing"?
5. Plain rectangles are boring - design with some randomness in mind!

1. Need to figure out how feasible it is for ONLY PUZZLE-based levels.
2. What to do about the level with the TimerChainLink entities?
    - It's not really a puzzle at all!
3. Having some levels be mechanics-based and some puzzle-based is weird
    - Makes it feel unfocused, including during development

ColorScheme
    - Singleton
    - getPrimaryColor
    - getSecondaryColor
    - isShadeOf(Color color)
        - Returns ColorSchemeColorType.PRIMARY or ColorSchemeColorType.SECONDARY
    - These are reset on ILevelLoadBeginEvent
    - Entities can decide which they want to be colored (via entity.json)
        - Default is "primary"
    - Player is always white
        - This should be overridden when Entity gets color from EntityDefinition
TiledMapObjectDetector
    - This will be used in MapLayerWrapper.correctCells
    - Detects the objects and then colors them via ColorScheme (which
        will have reset color beforehand in ILevelLoadBegin)
    - This will be run for ALL layers with 0 objects


- All public/private static final variables should be all-uppercase
- Make level 2 longer
- Color scheme?
- Get custom entity texture working
- Iteration-Complete dialog
- Back button goes to Main Menu (with dialog making sure)
- Fix input handling during tutorial (on desktop, at least)
- Make sure everything (that needs it) is disposed of
