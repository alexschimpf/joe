- ICON: Platform below player is breaking into a bunch of smaller pieces (maybe they get lighter, too)
- Maybe some entities could be swapped out with others at run-time for more randomization?
- What if you get 5 "lives" per level and once you use them all up, you get
moved to a new incomplete level?
    - If there is only one level left, it would ignore this
    - Keeps everything fresh and new
    - Prevents problem of getting "stuck" on a particular level (can deter people from continuing the game)
- Game doesn't need much explanation
    - Just reach the end of the level!
- run past a "post", then get to a certain point, activate something, then run back past the "post", and the map has (visibly) rotated over
- Scripts?
    - You reach the end of a chain
    - Now you must tell a MovableEntity to move
    - How do you do that?
        - MovableEntities MAY NOT need this functionality
- Particle effects
- Randomness???
- Need to cache texture regions in AssetManager??
- Figure out what to do about friction
    - Keep everything frictionless or not?
- Platforms that hang on a spring
    - More for effect
- Platforms that disappear and reappear
    - Few little "tricks"
