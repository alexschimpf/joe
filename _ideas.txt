- Game doesn't need much explanation
    - Just reach the end of the level!
- run past a "post", then get to a certain point, activate something, then run back past the "post", and the map has (visibly) rotated over
- Scripts?
    - You reach the end of a chain
    - Now you must tell a MovableEntity to move
    - How do you do that?
        - MovableEntities MAY NOT need this functionality
- Particle effects
- Randomness???
- Need to cache texture regions in AssetManager??
- Figure out what to do about friction
    - Keep everything frictionless or not?
- Platforms that hang on a spring
    - More for effect
- Platforms that disappear and reappear
    - Few little "tricks"



Tutorial
-----------------------------------------------
Each message must be acknowledged via touch before moving on to the next.
Each "speech box" should look like a straight black line leading to a transparent box
Maybe 1 second delay between next steps.

1. Hi, I'm Joe.
2. Now mindlessly follow my commands...
3. To make me move left/right, slide your finger here... [arrow points (and moves back and forth) on move button]
4. To make me jump, touch here... [arrow points (and moves back and forth) on jump button]
5. If you hold longer, I'll jump higher... [arrow is still pointing to jump button]
6. IMPORTANT: Each level is different. There will be no instructions. That's how it was designed.
7. Now... just get me to the end of each level.
